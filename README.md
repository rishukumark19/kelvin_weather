Kelvin Weather Converter 🌡️
A simple JavaScript tool to convert a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius, Fahrenheit, and the Newton scale.

This project demonstrates foundational JavaScript concepts, including variable declaration, arithmetic operations, and string interpolation.

✨ Project Origin
This project was completed as part of the "Build Web Apps with React" skill path on Codecademy. It serves as a practical exercise for mastering JavaScript basics.

The original project prompt was to build a converter that could:
- Take a static temperature in Kelvin.
- Convert it to Celsius.
- Convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.
- Log the final Fahrenheit temperature in a human-readable sentence.

🚀 How It Works
The script performs the following steps:

1.  **Set Kelvin Temperature**: A constant variable `kelvin` holds the temperature to be converted.
2.  **Calculate Celsius**: It subtracts 273 from the Kelvin temperature to get Celsius.
3.  **Calculate Fahrenheit**: It converts the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit and rounds it down to the nearest whole number.
4.  **Display Result**: It prints the final Fahrenheit temperature to the console.
5.  **[Optional] Calculate Newton**: It also includes a calculation to convert Celsius to the Newton scale and logs the result.

🔧 How to Use
1.  Clone this repository or download the `kelvin_weather.js` file.
2.  Open the `kelvin_weather.js` file in a text editor.
3.  Change the value of the `kelvin` variable to any temperature you want to convert.
4.  Run the script using Node.js:
    ```sh
    node kelvin_weather.js
    ```
5.  See the converted temperatures printed in your console!

Happy Coding!
